      <h2>The Life of Evagrius Ponticus</h2>
      
      <div> Evagrius (345–399) was son of a chorbishop of Ibora in Pontus, not far from the
         family estates of Basil the Great, who ordained him a reader, 371 or later. Evagrius
         accompanied Gregory of Nazianzus to Constantinople, where he was made archdeacon and
         participated in the Second Ecumenical Council (381). Fleeing the temptations of an
         affair
         (according to Palladius), Evagrius traveled to Jerusalem, where he joined the monastic
         communities of Melania the Elder and Rufinus, taking monastic vows in 383. He then
         went to
         Egypt, where toiled as one of the central figures of Egyptian monasticism. 
      </div>
      
      <div> In his extant writings, Evagrius says little about himself, so we depend upon other
         authors to reconstruct his life. Below are the chief ancient testimonia, in English
         translation. Texts have been truncated, to focus on parts relevant to Evagrius and
         his
         reception.

               thanks, both before God and before people. God will compensate him in greater things.
               But so that the smallest tokens of my friendship should not fall short, I desire that
               he be given one shirt, one tunic, two cloaks, and thirty gold pieces.

               Letter of the holy father Loukios to the holy father Evagrius. May God grant us the
               blessing of their prayers doubly.
            </div>
            
            <div>You, O father, have lived in the desert, as if at a mother's breast, for these many
               years, doing battle with the invisible enemies. O honored father Evagrius, you have
               put on the weapons of the soul's fitting labors, and you have become such an
               experienced combatant against the spirits of wickedness that not only have you become
               an object of fear among the demons, but you have also summoned others, so that they
               too might become combatants against the evil spirits and filthy thoughts.
            </div>
            
            <div>Therefore, I ask your fatherhood to classify the fight against the beings of
               darkness, and I entreat your holiness to compose for me some clear treatise
               concerning it and to acquaint me with the demons' entire treachery, which by their
               own efforts and according to their own undertaking they produce in the path of
               monasticism. Send it to us, so that we, your friends, might also easily cast off from
               ourselves those evil suggestions of theirs. For I know that you will attend to the
               one who requests from you spiritual things, and therefore I have addressed this to
               you. Farewell in the Lord.

            who was skilled in the discernment of thoughts, an ability he had acquired by
            experience. He often went down to Alexandria and refuted the pagan philosophers in
            disputations. This father exhorted the brothers who were with us not to satiate
            themselves with water. "For the demons," he said, "frequently light on well-watered
            places[.]" He taught us much else about <em>ascesis</em>, strengthening our souls.

            <div>3. These heretics have affinities with Gnosticism which may be traced to the
               impious teaching of Basilides. It is from him that you derive the assertion that
               without knowledge of the law it is impossible to avoid sin. But why do I speak of
               Priscillian who has been condemned by the whole world and put to death by the secular
               sword? Evagrius of Ibera in Pontus who sends letters to virgins and monks and among
               others to her whose name bears witness to the blackness of her perfidy, has published
               a book of maxims on apathy, or, as we should say, impassivity or imperturbability;
               a
               state in which the mind ceases to be agitated and—to speak
               simply—becomes either a stone or a God. His work is widely read, in the East
               in Greek and in the West in a Latin translation made by his disciple Rufinus. He has
               also written a book which professes to be about monks and includes in it many not
               monks at all whom he declares to have been Origenists, and who have certainly been
               condemned by the bishops. I mean Ammonius, Eusebius, Euthymius, Evagrius himself,
               Horus, Isidorus, and many others whom it would be tedious to enumerate.

            <div>Pref.1. [E]very one knows what was the contention of the Stoics and Peripatetics,
               that is, the old Academy, some of them asserted that the πάθη, which we may call
                  <em>emotions</em>, such as sorrow, joy, hope, fear, can be thoroughly eradicated
               from the minds of men; others that their power can be broken, that they can be
               governed and restrained, as unmanageable horses are held in check by peculiar kinds
               of bits. Their views have been explained by Tully in the "Tusculan Disputations," and
               Origen in his "Stromata" endeavours to blend them with ecclesiastical truth. I pass
               over Manichæus, Priscillianus, Evagrius of Ibora, Jovinianus, and the heretics found
               throughout almost the whole of Syria, who, by a perversion of the import of their
               name, are commonly called <em>Massalians</em>, in Greek, <em>Euchites</em>, all of
               whom hold that it is possible for human virtue and human knowledge to attain
               perfection, and arrive, I will not say merely at a likeness to, but an equality with
               God; and who go the length of asserting that, when once they have reached the height
               of perfection, even sins of thought and ignorance are impossible for them.

               me the following: "We found him suffering from an illness like this, having developed
               an ulcer of the sort called cancerous. We discovered him being treated by a doctor,
               and working with his hands and weaving palm-leaves and talking to us, while the rest
               of his body was being operated on. He was behaving just as if another man were being
               cut. Though the flesh was cut away like hair, he was insensible, thanks to the
               greatness of his religious preparation.

               disgusted that such a life had ended in such suffering and such surgical operations,
               he said to us: 'Children, do not be troubled by this affair. For God does nothing
               of
               what He does for malice, but for a good end. For perhaps my flesh deserves
               chastisement, and it is fitting that it should pay the penalty now rather than when
               I
               have quitted the arena.' So he edified us with his exhortations and

               toils was attacked by pride and flung off all restraints and cherished presumptuous

               Christ...."

            <div>Chapter 35. John of Lycopolis</div>
            
            <div>3. When we were in the desert of Nitria—by we I mean myself and the blessed
               Evagrius and his companions—we were anxious to find out accurately, in what
               [John of Lycopolis's] virtue consisted. Then said the blessed Evagrius: "Gladly would
               I be learning what kind of man he is, from some one who knows how to test character
               and speech. For if I am unable to see him myself, but can hear accurately from
               another's description the details of his manner of life, then I will not go so far
               as
               the mountain." I heard, and saying nothing to anyone kept silence for one day; but
               the next day, having closed my cell and committed myself and it to God, I hastened
               away to the Thebaid. 
            </div>
            
            <div>4. And I arrived after eighteen days, having gone partly on foot, and partly by
               boat on the river. But it was the time of the flood, when many are ill; which was
               also my experience. Well, I went and found the vestibule of his cell closed; for the
               brethren built on later a very large vestibule holding about 100 men, and shutting
               it
               with a key they opened it on Saturday and Sunday. So, having learned the reason why
               it was closed, I waited quietly till the Saturday. And having come at the second hour
               for an interview I found him sitting by the window, through which he seemed to be
               exhorting his visitors. 
            </div>
            
            <div>5. So, after greeting me, he said through an interpreter: "Whence are you? and why
               have you come? For I conjecture that you belong to the convent of Evagrius." I said:
               "I am a stranger who started out from Galatia." And I confessed that I belonged to
               Evagrius' society....

            <div>Chapter 38. Evagrius Ponticus</div>
            
            <div>1. It is not right to be silent about the story of the illustrious deacon Evagrius,
               a man who lived in apostolic wise; rather one ought to put it into writing for the
               edification of readers and the glory of the goodness of our Saviour. I have thought
               it worth while to relate (the story) from the beginning, how he came to his ideal,
               and how having pursued asceticism worthily he died in the desert at the age of
               fifty-four, according to the words of Scripture: "In a little time he fulfilled many
               years."
            </div>
            
            <div>2. He came of a Pontic family and belonged to the city of Ibora, the son of a
               country-bishop. He was ordained reader by the holy Basil, the bishop of the church
               of
               Caesarea. After the death of the holy Basil, Gregory Nazianzea the bishop, that very
               wise and most impassive and highly cultured man, ordained him deacon. Then at the
               great synod of Constantinople he left him to the blessed Nectarius the bishop, since
               he was skilled in argument against all heresies. And he flourished in the great city,
               speaking with youthful zeal against every heresy.
            </div>
            
            <div>3. Now it happened that this man, who was held in high honour by the whole city,
               was congealed by an image of the desire of a woman, as he himself told us at a later
               time, when his soul was freed from such thoughts. The woman loved him in return; now
               she belonged to the highest rank. So Evagrius, fearing God and respecting his own
               conscience, and putting before his eyes the greatness of the shame and the malicious
               joy of the heresies, prayed to God in supplication that he would put some obstacle
               in
               the way. Now the woman was pressing and madly excited, while he, though desiring to
               withdraw, had no power to, being constrained by the chains of this servitude.
            </div>
            
            <div>4. After no long time, when his prayer had succeeded but he had not experienced the
               benefit of it, there appeared to him an angel vision in the shape of soldiers of the
               governor, and they seized him and took him apparently to the tribunal and threw him
               into the so-called custody, the men who had come to him, as it seemed, without giving
               a reason having first fastened his neck and hands with iron collars and chains. But
               he knew in his conscience that for the sake of the above fault he was suffering these
               things, and imagined that her husband had intervened.
            </div>
            
            <div>5. So now he was extremely anxious. Another trial was going on and others were
               being put to torture for some accusation, so he continued to be much perturbed. And
               the angel who brought the vision transformed himself to represent the coming of a
               genuine friend and said to him, tied up as he was among forty prisoners chained
               together: "Why are you retained here, my lord deacon?" He said to him: "In truth I
               do
               not know, but I have a suspicion that so-and-so the ex-governor has laid a charge
               against me, impelled by an absurd jealousy. And I fear that the judge corrupted by
               bribes may inflict punishment on me."
            </div>
            
            <div>6. He said to him: "If you will listen to your friend, it is not expedient for you
               to stay in this city." Evagrius said to him: "If God will release me from this
               misfortune and you see me in Constantinople (any more), know that I shall suffer this
               punishment justly." He said to him: "Let me bring the gospel, and swear to me by it
               that you will leave this city and care for your soul, and I will free you from this
               durance."
            </div>
            
            <div>7. So he brought the gospel and he swore to him by the gospel: "Except for one day,
               to give me time to put my clothes on board, I certainly will not remain." So when
               the
               oath had been produced, he came back out of the trance which had come on him in the
               night; and he arose and argued with himself: "Even if the oath was in a trance,
               nevertheless I did take it." So having put all his belongings into the ship he went
               to Jerusalem.
            </div>
            
            <div>8. And there he was received by the blessed Melania, the Roman lady. But once again
               the devil hardened his heart, as he did Pharaoh's, and since he was young and
               vigorous doubts beset him, and he hesitated, saying nothing to any one, and changing
               his clothes and his habit of speech back to his old ways, vain-glory stupefying him.
               But God Who wards off destruction from us all involved him in a bout of fever, and
               after that in a long illness lasting six months, drying up his flesh, the source of
               his trouble.
            </div>
            
            <div>9. But when the physicians were at a loss and could find no way of cure, the
               blessed Melania said to him: "Son, your long illness does not please me. Tell me
               therefore what are your thoughts. For this illness of yours is not without God." Then
               he confessed to her the whole matter. But she said to him: "Give me your word before
               the Lord that you will keep to the mark of the monastic life; and, sinner though I
               am, I will pray that you may be granted a furlough of life." And he consented. So
               within a few days he got well, and he arose and received a change of clothes at the
               hands of the lady herself and went away and exiled himself in the mount of Nitria
               which is in Egypt.
            </div>
            
            <div>10. Having lived there two years, in the third year he entered the desert. So he
               lived fourteen years in the place they call Cellia, and he used to eat a pound of
               bread, and in three months a pint of oil, though he was a man who had come from a
               luxurious and refined and voluptuous life. And he made prayers; and he wrote during
               the year only the value of what he ate—for he wrote the Oxyrhyncus characters
               excellently. So in the course of fifteen years having purified his mind to the utmost
               he was counted worthy of the gift of knowledge and wisdom and the discerning of
               spirits. So he composed three holy books for monks, called <em>Antirrhetica</em>, in
               which he taught the arts to be used against demons.
            </div>
            
            <div>11. The demon of fornication troubled him grievously, as indeed he told us himself.
               And all night long he stood naked in the well, though it was winter, so that his
               flesh was frozen. On another occasion again the spirit of blasphemy troubled him.
               And
               for forty days he did not enter under a roof, as he told us himself, so that his body
               threw out ticks, like the bodies of irrational animals. Three demons attacked him
               by
               day disguised as clerics, questioning him on the faith. And one said he was an Arian,
               the other an Eunomian, the third an Apollinarian; and he vanquished these in his
               wisdom by means of a few words.
            </div>
            
            <div>12. Again one day, the key of the church having been lost, having made the sign
               over the front of the lock and pushed with his hand, he opened it, after first
               calling upon Christ. So many castigations did he receive from demons and so great
               trial of them did he have that there is no counting the occasions. And to one of his
               disciples he told the things that would happen to him after eighteen years, having
               prophesied all to him in a vision (of the future). And he said: "From the time that
               I
               took to the desert, I have not touched lettuce nor any other green vegetable, nor
               any
               fruit, nor grapes, nor meat, nor a bath."
            </div>
            
            <div>13. And later, in the sixteenth year of his life without cooked food, his flesh
               felt a need, owing to the weakness of the stomach, to partake of (something that had
               been) on the fire; he did not however take bread even now, but having fed on herbs
               or
               gruel or pulse for two years, in this regime he died, after communicating in church
               at Epiphany. Shortly before his death he told us: "For three years I have not been
               troubled by fleshly desire—after so long a life and toil and labour and
               ceaseless prayer." He was told of the death of his father, and said to his informant:
               "Cease blaspheming, for my father is immortal."

            <div>Prologue</div>
            
            <div>1 I will now also begin to speak about Apa Evagrius, the deacon from
               Constantinople, upon whom the bishop Gregory laid hands. Indeed, it is right that
               we
               relate the virtues of him whom everyone praises: he lived the apostolic way of life.
               For it would not be just if we were silent about his progress and &lt;works&gt;
               acceptable to God; rather, it is right that we put them into writing for the
               edification and profit of those who read about them so they may glorify God our
               Savior who empowers human beings to do these things.

            <div>Palladius Testifies as an Eyewitness</div>
            
            <div>2 Indeed, it was also he who taught me the way of life in Christ and he who helped
               me understand Holy Scripture spiritually and told me what old wives’ tales are [1
               Tim. 4:7] in order that, as it is written, sin might be revealed as a sinner [Rom
               7:13], for the whole time I was in that monastic settlement I was with him, each of
               us living enclosed and apart. I was by his side Saturday night and during the day
               on
               Sunday. In order that someone not think that I am praising him or showing favoritism
               towards him, as Christ is my witness I saw the majority of his virtues with my own
               eyes as well as the wonders that he performed. These I will write down for you for
               the profit of those who will read about them and for those who will hear them read
               so
               they will glorify Christ who gives power to his poor to do what is pleasing to
               him.
            </div>
            
            <div>Palladius' Own Testimony</div>
            
            <div>3 I myself have been deemed worthy to inform you how he lived, from the beginning
               of his life until he arrived at these measures and these great ascetic practices
               until he completed sixty years, and in this way went to his rest, as it is written,
               “In a short period of time he completed a multitude of years” [Wis. 4:13]. 
            </div>
            
            <div>Evagrius' Origins and Early Years</div>
            
            <div>4 This man of whom we speak was a citizen of Pontus, which is where his family was
               from. He was the son of a priest from Iberia whom the blessed Basil, bishop of
               Cappadocia, had made a priest for the church in Arkeus. After the death of Saint
               Basil the bishop, and his father in God the priest, Evagrius went to Constantinople,
               a city filled with learning, for he walked in the footsteps of Saint Basil. He
               attached himself to Gregory [of Nazianzus], the bishop of Constantinople, and when
               the bishop saw his learning and good intelligence, he made him a deacon, for truly
               he
               was a wise person, being in possession of himself and without passions, and was a
               deacon of steadfast character. Indeed, he himself attended [the Council of]
               Constantinople with our fathers the bishops at the time of the synod that took place
               in Constantinople, and he was victorious over all the heretics. Thus this evagrius
               and Nectarius the bishop debated with each other face to face, for truly Evagrius
               was
               very protective of the Scriptures and was well equipped to refute every heresy with
               his wisdom. He was therefore well known throughout Constantinople for having combated
               the heretics with forceful and eloquent language.
            </div>
            
            <div>Evagrius Lusts after a Married Woman</div>
            
            <div>5 The whole city praised him greatly. After all this learning [. . .] on account of
               his pride and arrogance, he fell into the hands of the demon who brings about lustful
               thoughts for women, as he told us later after he had been freed from this passion.
               Indeed, the woman loved him very much in return. But Evagrius was fearful before God
               and did not sin with her because, in fact, the woman was married and Evagrius also
               fallowed his conscience because her husband was a member of the nobility and greatly
               honored and, furthermore, Evagrius thought deeply about the magnitude of shame and
               sin and judgment and realized that all the &lt;heretics&gt; whom he had humiliated would
               rejoice. He beseeched God continuously, praying that he help free him from the
               passion and warfare that he had been subjected to, for in truth the woman persisted
               in &lt;her&gt; madness for him to the point that she made a public spectacle of herself.
               He wanted to flee from her but could not summon up the courage to do so for in truth
               his thoughts were held captive by pleasure like a child.
            </div>
            
            <div>Angels Appear to Arrest Evagrius</div>
            
            <div>6 God's mercy did not delay in coming to him but through his entreaties and prayers
               God came to him quickly. He comforted him through a revelation so that nothing evil
               could get at him with the woman. In a vision at night, the Lord sent angels to him
               dressed in radiant clothing who looked like soldiers of the prefect. They made him
               stand and seized him as though they were taking him before a judge, as though they
               had bound him in ropes along with other thieves, having put a collar around his neck
               and chains on his feet, acting as though they were arresting him but without telling
               him the charges or why they had seized him. But he thought in his heart that they
               had
               come after him on account of the affair with the woman, thinking that her husband
               had
               accused him before the prefect.

            <div>An Angel Visits Evagrius Disguised as a Friend</div>
            
            <div>7 Afterwards he was utterly astonished, and the angel who had appeared to him
               changed form in front of him, taking on the appearance of one of his friends who had
               come to pay him a visit and comfort him. he said to Evagrius, who was bound with the
               thieves, "Deacon Evagrius, why have you been arrested, sir?"
            </div>
            
            <div>Evagrius said to him, "The truth is, I don't know, but I think someone denounced
               me, perhaps because he was seized by ignorant jealousy. So I'm afraid that he's given
               money to the judge so he will quickly and violently destroy me."
            </div>
            
            <div>The angel said to him, "If you will listen to me, who am your friend, then I will
               tell you: It is not good for you to stay in this city."
            </div>
            
            <div>Evagrius said to him, "If God delivers me from this trouble and you still see me in
               this city of Constantinople, say 'You deserve this punishment.'"
            </div>
            
            <div>The angel who had taken on the appearance of a friend said to him, "I will give you
               the Gospel; swear to me 'I will not remain in this city,' and that you will be
               concerned about the salvation of your soul. I will save you from this trouble."
            </div>
            
            <div>And he swore to him upon the Gospel, "Give me one day to load my clothes on the
               boat and I swear to you I will leave this city."
            </div>
            
            <div>After he had sworn, he awoke from the vision he had seen at night and said, "Even
               if I swore in a dream, nevertheless I have sworn this oath." He immediately got up,
               loaded his things and his clothes on the boat, and set sail for Jerusalem.

            <div>Evagrius goes to Melania but Lapses and Becomes Ill</div>
            
            <div>8 Blessed Melania the Roman joyfully welcomed him. But once again the Devil
               hardened his heart as in the time of Pharaoh [Ex 7:14], and his heart doubted and
               became divided; and on account of his boiling youthfulness and his very learned
               speech, and because of his large and splendid wardrobe (he would change clothes twice
               a day), he fell into vain habits and bodily pleasure. But God, who always keeps
               destruction from his people, sent a tempest of fever and chills upon him until he
               contracted a grave illness that persisted until his flesh became as thin as
               thread.

            <div>Evagrius Confesses, Heals, and Leaves for Egypt</div>
            
            <div>This illness afflicted him with every sort of hidden suffering so that the doctors
               were perplexed and were unable to cure him. Saint Melania said to him, "Evagrius,
               my
               child, this persistent illness does not lpease me. Do not hide your thoughts from
               me;
               perhaps I will be able to cure you. Tell me your thoughts in all honesty, for I can
               see by looking at you that this illness has not come over you without God's
               permission." The he revealed all his thoughts to her. She said to him, "Give me your
               word that you will take the monastic habit and, although I am a sinner, I will
               entreat my God through his grace to make you whole." He gave her his word and after
               a
               few days he was healthy again. He arose and took the monastic habit and left. He
               walked and came to the monastic settlement of Pernouj, which is in Egypt.

            <div>10 And he remained there two years and the third year he left there and went to the
               desert of the Cells. He remained there sixteen years, undertaking there numerous
               ascetic practices, and he went to his rest at sixty years of age. He did not see the
               bitterness of the body's old age and thus went to his rest as it is written: "In a
               short while he completed many years and he was quickly taken ot the Lord so that evil
               might not alter his understanding."

            </div>
            
            <div>The old man said to him, "Do not eat anything in order to be filled up, neither

               he did not judge anyone, so that we recognized his maturity from the beginning. He
               said one hundred prayers a day, while being a very skilled scribe.

            <div>13 At the end of nearly eight years of keeping a stringent regimen of ascetic
               practice without relaxing it at all, he managed to damage his bowels and because the
               food he ate was like stones his bladder hurt him. The elders had him change his
               ascetic regimen and thus he did not eat bread until the day he died but would eat
               a
               few herbs and a little cooked barley, which proved sufficient for him until he spent
               his little bit of time. As for fruit or anything else that gives the body pleasure,
               he did not eat them nor did he allow his servants to eat them. This was his ascetic
               regimen with regard to food.

            <div>Evagrius' Contemplative Practices</div>
            
            <div>14 With regard to sleep, he followed a rule: he would sleep a third of the night,
               but during the day he would not sleep at all. He had a courtyard where he would spend
               the middle part of each day walking, driving away sleep from himself, training his
               intellect to examine his thoughts systematically. When he had finished sleeping a
               third of the night, he would spend the rest of the night walking in the courtyard,
               meditating and praying, driving sleep away from himself, training his intellect to
               reflect on the meaning of the Scriptures.

            <div>Evagrius' Gifts</div>
            
            <div>15 He possessed a very pure intelligence and was deemed worthy to receive the gift
               of wisdom and knowledge and discernment, with which he categorized the works of the
               demons.
            </div>
            
            <div>Evagrius' Fidelity to the Church and His Writings</div>
            
            <div>16 And he was very scrupulous with regard to the Holy Scriptures and the orthodox
               traditions of the Catholic Church. Indeed, the books he wrote testify to his teaching
               and knowledge and remarkable intelligence. For he wrote three books of teaching: one
               concerning the cenobitic monks, another concerning the monks who lived in cells in
               the desert, and another concerning the priests of God in order for them to be
               vigilant with regard to their duties in the sanctuary. These three works teach
               everyone to live a good life, to possess a firm understanding, and to have an
               orthodox way of seeing things according to the traditions of the Church.

            <div>Evagrius the Spiritual Director</div>
            
            <div>17 This was his practice: The brother would gather around him on Saturday and
               Sunday, discussing their thoughts with him throughout the night, listening to his
               words of encouragement until sunrise. And thus they would leave rejoicing and
               glorifying God, for Evagrius' teaching was very sweet. When they came to see him,
               he
               encouraged them, saying to them, "My brothers, if one of you has either a profound
               or
               a troubled thought, let him be silent until the brothers depart and let him reflect
               on it alone with me. Let us not make him speak in front of the brothers lest a little
               one perish on account of his thoughts and grief swallow him at a gulp."
            </div>
            
            <div>Evagrius' Hospitality</div>
            
            <div>18 Furthermore, he was so hospitable that his cell never lacked five or six
               visitors a day who had come from foreign lands to listen to his teaching, his
               intellect, and his ascetic practice. As a result, he had money because in truth large
               numbers of people wolud sed it to him. You would find more than two hundred coins
               in
               his possession which he would entrust to his steward who served in his house at all
               times.

            <div>19 Numerous times Apa Theophilus the archbishop wished to take him and make him
               bishop of Thmoui, but he would not agree to this and fled from the archbishop so he
               could not ordain him.

            <div>20 One time the demons paid him a visit and wounded him several times. We heard
               their voices but did not see them. They struck him at night with ox-hide whips and,
               as God is our witness, we saw with our own eyes the wounds they inflicted on his
               body.

            <div>21 If you [sing.] want to know the experiences that he underwent at the hands of
               the demons, read the book he wrote concerning the suggestions of the demons. You will
               see their full power and various temptations. Indeed, it was for this reason that
               he
               wrote about these subjects, in order that those who read about them might be
               comforted knowing that they are not alone in suffering such temptations, and he
               showed us how such thoughts could be mastered through this or that kind of practice.
               It is remarkable that such a person managed to escape notice from the
               beginning.

            <div>22 One time the demons so increased in him the desire for fornication that he
               thought in his heart that God had abandoned him, as he told us, and he spent the
               whole night standing naked and praying in the cistern of water in winter until his
               flesh became as hard as rock.

            <div>23 Another time, moreover, the spirit of blasphemy tormented him and he spent forty
               days without entering under the lintel of a cell until his whole body was covered
               with vermin like the body of an irrational animal [Dan 4:25–30].

            <div>Evagrius' Mystical Ascent</div>
            
            <div>24 A few days later he told us about the revelations he had seen. He never hid
               anything from his disciples. "It happened, " he said, "while I was sitting in my cell
               at night with the lamp burning beside me, meditatively reading one of the prophets.
               In the middle of the night I became enraptured and I found myself as though I were
               in
               a dream in sleep and I saw myself as though I were suspended in the air up to the
               clouds and I looked down on the whole inhabited world. And the one who suspended me
               said to me, 'Do you see all these things?' He raised me up to the clouds nad I saw
               the whole universe at the same time. I said to him, 'Yes." He said to me, 'I am going
               to give you a commandment. If you keep it, you will be the ruler of all these things
               that you see.' He spoke to me again, 'Go, be compassionate, humble, and keep your
               thoughts pointed straight to God. You will rule over all these things.' Wehn he had
               finished saying these things ot me, I saw myself holding the book once again with
               the
               wick burning and I did not know how I had been taken up to the clouds. Whether I was
               in the flesh, I do not know; God knows. Or whether I was in the mind, once again I
               do
               not know" [2 Cor 12:2]. And so he contended with these two virtues [of compassion
               and
               humility] as though he possessed all the virtues.
            </div>
            
            <div>Evagrius Teaches about Humility</div>
            
            <div>25 He used to say that humility leads the intellect into right knowledge, drawing
               it upward, for it is written, "He shall teach the humble their paths" [Ps 24:9].
               Indeed, this virtue is one the angels possess. Concerning the purity of the body,
               he
               used to say that "the monks are not alone with teh virgins in possessing it. This
               virtue is theirs but it is also a virtue that numerous lay persons have who maintain
               purity, but since not all of them possess purity of body, 'seek out,' it says, 'peace
               with everyone, and purity, without which no noe will see the Lord'" [Heb
               12:14].

            <div>The Purity of His Language</div>
            
            <div>26 It was impossible to find a worldly word in the mouth of Apa Evagrius or a
               mocking word, and he refused to listen to another person using such words.
            </div>
            
            <div>Evagrius Saves a Tribun's Wife in Palestine</div>
            
            <div>27 We also heard about this other wonderful matter: When he fled from Apa
               Theophilus, who wanted to make him bishop of Thmoui, he fled and went to Palestine
               and happened upon a tribune's wife who was possessed by an unclean demonic spirit.
               She would enjoy nothing from all of creation, for the demon taught her this practice
               as though this were the way the angels lived. Furthermore, she had not gone to her
               husband's bed for many years. When Apa Evagrius the man of God encountered her, he
               returned the woman's heart to God by means of a single word and a single prayer, she
               and her husband at the same time. For she used to repeat some things said by
               philosophers outside of the faith without understanding what she was saying, saying
               things that would have been wondeful if another person had said them. Evagrius gained
               her salvation in the Lord and brought about her reconciliation with her husband in
               peace.

            <div>Discerning Good and Evil Events</div>
            
            <div>28 One time when he was in the desert, an old man who was fleeing from the
               presbyterate came to see him. While he was on his way, walking on the road, his bread
               gave out. When his disciple was about to faint from hunger, he stopped on the road
               and an angel placed a pair of loaves before him and put them on the road that led
               into the mountain. When the old man arrived at Apa Evagrius', he said to him, "When
               I
               was on my way to see you, I and my servant, we got hungry on the road. We did not
               find bread to eat. My servant was about to collapse from not eating and after we
               placed some skins down on the ground, we genuflected. While we were bent to the
               ground, the smell of hot bread came to us and when I got up I found two loaves of
               hot
               bread in front of me and when each of us had taken a loaf, we ate it, we recovered
               our strength, we started walking, and came to you." Indeed, I myself happened to be
               sitting there while he said these words to Apa Evagrius concerning the miracle that
               had happened to him. "Tell me, therefore," he said, "whether or not a demon has the
               power to do something like this."
            </div>
            
            <div>Apa Evagrius said to him, "You and I have both had such events happen to us. A few
               days ago I too went to visit the brothers. As I was walking along, i found on the
               road a money purse with three solidi in it. I stopped and sat down beside it lest
               someone had dropped it and would not be back to search for it. Although I spent a
               day
               sitting there, no one came to look for the money. I did not know where i could send
               the money because in truth I did not know who it belonged to. I sent [my steward]
               to
               the villages closest to me to ask whether or not someone had lost a money purse the
               past few days. When I didn't find anyone, i ordered my steward to distribute the
               money to strangers. Whether it was an angel or whether it was a demon that had left
               the purpse, we distributed the money. As for you and me, whether what happened in
               our
               cases occurred on account of an angel or on account of a demon, let us give glory
               to
               God, for occurrences like these do not profit the soul at all except to purify it.
               Nevertheless, I give glory to you for having received food from an angel. Yes ,it
               is
               possible for demons to steal some loaves of bread and bring them to someone, but such
               loaves will not nourish the body because things that belong to demons stink and if
               something comes from the demons the soul is confused when it sees it. If, however,
               it
               comes from the angels, the soul is not confused but remains steadfast and at peace
               at
               that time. Therefore, the person who is worthy to receive food from the angels first
               of all possesesses discernment in thinking about the saying of the Apostle, who says,
               'Solid food is for the perfect, for those whos faculties have been trained by
               practice to distinguish evil from good'" [Heb 5:14].

            <div>29 Once again, three demons in the form of servants of the Church came to see him
               one day in the heat of midday, and they were dressed in such a way that they were
               able to prevent him from recognizing them and seeing that they were demons. On
               account of this, after they had left and he found the door closed, he realized that
               they were demons, but he did not realize it at first. They had given the appearance
               of discussing with him the subject of faith in the Scriptures, and each of them told
               him his concern and they said to him, "We have heard it said about you that you speak
               articulately about the orthodox faith; therefore, we have come to you so you might
               satisfy our concerns." He said to them, "Ask what you wish."
            </div>
            
            <div>The first said to him, "I am a Eunomian. I have come to you so you might tell me
               whether the Father is begotten or unbegotten." Apa Evagrius said to him, "I will not
               answer you because you have asked a bad question, for it is not right to talk about
               the nature of the Unbegotten and to inquire whether it is begotten or
               unbegotten."
            </div>
            
            <div>When the first realized that Evagrius had defeated him, he pushed his companion
               forward. When he had come forward, he first said [to his companion], "You've put your
               question badly." Apa Evagrius said to him, "And you, who are you?" He said, "I am
               an
               arian."Apa Evagrius said to him, "And you in turn, what do you seek?" He said to him,
               "I am asking about the Holy Spirit and about the body of Christ, whether or not it
               was truly him whom Mary bore." Saint Evagrius said to him, "The Holy Spirit is
               neither an offspring nor a creature. All creatures are limited to a place. All
               creatures are subject to change and are sanctified by him who is better than
               they."
            </div>
            
            <div>[The third one said,] "You have defeated these two, for some [. . .] will you wish
               to speak to me too?" The old man said to [him], "What do you seek, you, you who pride
               yourself in doing battle?" The demon said to him, "Me? I'm not arguing with anyone,
               but my mind is not persuaded or certain that Christ received human intelligence.
               Rather, in place of intellect God himself was in him. Indeed, it is impossible for
               human intelligence to cast out the Prince of Demons from human beings and defeat him.
               Indeed, human intelligence can not exist in the body with God."
            </div>
            
            <div>Apa Evagrius said to him, "If he did not receive human intelligence, he did not
               receive human flesh either. If, therefore, [he] received human flesh from [Mary the]
               holy Virgin, then [he] also [became] human, wiwh a soul [and intellect], being
               complete in everything human except sin alone [Heb 4:15]. For it is impossible for
               the body to exist [without receiving] a soul and intellect. If, therefore, he did
               not
               receive thes, then he is called Christ in vain. Therefore, the unchangeable Logos,
               the only-begotten Son of the Father [Jn 1:14, 3:18], received a human body and soul
               and intellect and everything human except sin.
            </div>
            
            <div>"Therefore let it suffice us at the present to offer solely the apostle Paul as a
               witness, who, bringing together the faith in a single unity, speaks of a single
               divinity and a single royalty: the consubstantial and unchanging Trinity. 'For," he
               says, 'one is God, one is the mediator between God and humankind, Jesus Christ,' the
               Son of God the Father, with the one Holy Spirit, one baptism, one catholic Chruch,
               one resurrection of the dead at the time of [. . .] as [Paul has said] [. . .] you
               (pl.) deny the full mystery of the Holy Trinity. One of you has made the Logos a
               creature, another has made the Holy Spirit a creature and [denied] the body of
               Christ, and another has killed the soul and body of Christ [. . .]

            <div>3.7. If we may express our own judgment concerning substance and personality, it
               appears to us that the Greek philosophers have given us various definitions of
               <em>ousia</em>, but have not taken the slightest notice of <em>hypostasis</em>....
               But although the ancient philosophical writers scarcely noticed
               [<em>hypostasis</em>], the more modern ones have frequently used it instead of
               <em>ousia</em>. This term, as we before observed, has been variously defined: but
               can that which is capable of being circumscribed by a definition be applicable to
               God
               who is incomprehensible? Evagrius in his <em>Monachicus</em>, cautions us against
               rash and inconsiderate language in reference to God; forbidding all attempt to define
               the divinity, inasmuch as it is wholly simple in its nature: "for," says he,
               "definition belongs only to things which are compound." [= <em>Gnostikos</em> 27] The
               same author further adds, "Every proposition has either a 'genus' which is predicted,
               or a 'species,' or a 'differentia,' or a 'proprium,' or an 'accidens,' or that which
               is compounded of these: but none of these can be supposed to exist in the sacred
               Trinity. Let then what is inexplicable be adored in silence." [= <em>Gnostikos</em>
               41] Such is the reasoning of Evagrius, of whom we shall again speak hereafter.
            </div>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="text">
            
            <div>4.23. Evagrius became a disciple of these men, acquired from them the philosophy of
               deeds, whereas he had previously known that which consisted in words only. He was
               ordained deacon at Constantinople by Gregory of Nazianzus, and afterwards went with
               him into Egypt, where he became acquainted with these eminent persons, and emulated
               their course of conduct, and miracles were done by his hands as numerous and
               important as those of his preceptors. Books were also composed by him of very
               valuable nature, one of which is entitled <em>The Monk</em> [= CPG 2435, <em>Ad
                  monachos</em>], or, <em>On Active Virtue</em> [= CPG 2430, <em>Praktikos</em>];
               another <em>The Gnostic</em> [= CPG 2431, <em>Gnostikos</em>], or, <em>To him who is
                  deemed worthy of Knowledge</em>: this book is divided into fifty chapters. A third
               is designated <em>Antirrheticus</em> [= CPG 2434], and contains selections from the
               Holy Scriptures against tempting spirits, distributed into eight parts, according
               to
               the number of the arguments. He wrote moreover <em>Six Hundred Prognostic
                  Problems</em> [= CPG 2432, <em>Kephalaia gnostika</em>], and also two compositions
               in verse, one addressed <em>To the Monks living in Communities</em> [= CPG 2435,
               <em>Chapters to Monks</em>], and the other <em>To the Virgin</em> [= CPG 2436,
               <em>Sentences to a Virgin</em>]. Whoever shall read these productions will be
               convinced of their excellence. It will not be out of place here, I conceive, to
               subjoin to what has been before stated, a few things mentioned by him respecting the
               monks. These are his words [= <em>Praktikos</em> 91–95, 97–99]:
            </div>
            
            <div>"It becomes us to enquire into the habits of the pious monks who have preceded us,
               in order that we may correct ourselves by their example: for undoubtedly very many
               excellent things have been said and done by them. One of them was accustomed to say,
               that 'a drier and not irregular diet combined with love, would quickly conduct a monk
               into the haven of tranquillity.' The same individual freed one of his brethren from
               being troubled by apparitions at night, by enjoining him to minister while fasting
               to
               the sick. And being asked why he prescribed this: 'Such affections,' said he, 'are
               by
               nothing so effectually dissipated as by the exercise of compassion.'
            </div>
            
            <div>"A certain philosopher of those times coming to Anthony the Just, said to him, 'How
               can you endure, father, being deprived of the comfort of books?' 'My book, O
               philosopher,' replied Anthony, 'is the nature of things that are made, and it is
               present whenever I wish to read the words of God.'
            </div>
            
            <div>"That 'chosen vessel,' the aged Egyptian Macarius, asked me, why the strength of
               the faculty of memory is impaired by cherishing the remembrance of injury received
               from men; while by remembering those done us by devils it remains uninjured? And when
               I hesitated, scarcely knowing what answer to make, and begged him to account for it:
               'Because,' said he, 'the former is an affection contrary to nature, and the latter
               is
               conformable to the nature of the mind.'
            </div>
            
            <div>"Going on one occasion to the holy father Macarius about mid-day, and being
               overcome with the heat and thirst, I begged for some water to drink: 'Content
               yourself with the shade,' was his reply, 'for many who are now journeying by land,
               or
               sailing on the deep, are deprived even of this.' Discussing with him afterwards the
               subject of abstinence, 'Take courage, my son,' said he: 'for twenty years I have
               neither eaten, drunk, nor slept to satiety; my bread has always been weighed, my
               water measured, and what little sleep I have had has been stolen by reclining myself
               against a wall.'
            </div>
            
            <div>"The death of his father was announced to one of the monks: 'Cease your blasphemy,'
               said he to the person that told him; 'my father is immortal.'
            </div>
            
            <div>"One of the brethren who possessed nothing but a copy of the Gospels, sold it, and
               distributed the price in food to the hungry, uttering this memorable saying—'I
               have sold the book which says, "Sell that thou hast and give to the poor."'
            </div>
            
            <div>"There is an island about the northern part of the city of Alexandria, beyond the
               lake called Maria, where a monk from Parembole dwells, in high repute among the
               Gnostics. This person was accustomed to say, that all the deeds of the monks were
               done for one of these five reasons;—on account of God, nature, custom,
               necessity, or manual labor. The same also said that there was only one virtue in
               nature, but that it assumes various characteristics according to the dispositions
               of
               the soul: just as the light of the sun is itself without form, but accommodates
               itself to the figure of that which receives it.
            </div>
            
            <div>"Another of the monks said, 'I withdraw myself from pleasures, in order to cut off
               the occasions of anger: for I know that it always contends for pleasures, disturbing
               my tranquillity of mind, and unfitting me for the attainment of knowledge.' One of
               the aged monks said that 'Love knows not how to keep a deposit either of provisions
               or money.' He added, 'I never remember to have been twice deceived by the devil in
               the same thing.'"
            </div>
            
            <div>Thus wrote Evagrius in his book entitled <em>Practice</em> [= CPG 2430,
               <em>Praktikos</em>]. And in that which he called <em>The Gnostic</em> he says [=
               <em>Gnostikos</em> 44–48], "'We have learned from Gregory the Just, that
               there are four virtues, having distinct characteristics:—prudence and
               fortitude, temperance and justice. That it is the province of prudence to contemplate
               the sacred and intelligent powers apart from expression, because these are unfolded
               by wisdom: of fortitude to adhere to truth against all opposition, and never to turn
               aside to that which is unreal: of temperance to receive seed from the chief
               husbandman, but to repel him who would sow over it seed of another kind: and finally,
               of justice to adapt discourse to every one, according to their condition and
               capacity; stating some things obscurely, others in a figurative manner, and
               explaining others clearly for the instruction of the less intelligent.'
            </div>
            
            <div>"That pillar of truth, Basil of Cappadocia, used to say that 'the knowledge which
               men teach is perfected by constant study and exercise; but that which proceeds from
               the grace of God, by the practice of justice, patience, and mercy.' That the former
               indeed is often developed in persons who are still subject to the passions; whereas
               the latter is the portion of those only who are superior to their influence, and who
               during the season of devotion, contemplate that peculiar light of the mind which
               illumines them.
            </div>
            
            <div>"That luminary of the Egyptians, holy Athanasius, assures us 'that Moses was
               commanded to place the table on the north side. Let the Gnostics therefore understand
               what wind is contrary to them, and so nobly endure every temptation, and minister
               nourishment with a willing mind to those who apply to them.'
            </div>
            
            <div>"Serapion, the angel of the church of the Thmuïtae, declared that 'the mind is
               completely purified by drinking in spiritual knowledge': that 'charity cures the
               inflammatory tendencies of the soul'; and that 'the depraved lusts which spring up in
               it are restrained by abstinence.'</div>
            
            <div>"'Exercise thyself continually,' said the great and enlightened teacher Didymus,
               'in reflecting on providence and judgment; and endeavor to bear in memory the
               material of whatever discourses thou mayst have heard on these topics, for almost
               all
               fail in this respect. Thou wilt find reasonings concerning judgment in the difference
               of created forms, and the constitution of the universe: sermons on providence
               comprehended in those means by which we are led from vice and ignorance to virtue
               and
               knowledge.'"
            </div>
            
            <div>These few extracts from Evagrius we thought it would be appropriate to insert
               here.

               the bishopric by Paul, who had formerly been a teacher of the Latin language: but
               afterwards, setting aside the Latin language, had devoted himself to an ascetic
               course of life; and having founded a monastery of religious men, he adopted a mode
               of
               living not very different from that pursued by the monks in the desert. In fact I
               myself found him just such a person as Evagrius says the monks dwelling in the
               deserts ought to be; imitating them in continued fastings, silence, abstinence from
               animal food, and for the most part abstaining also from the use of oil and
               wine.

            <div>6.30 Ammon was ever after surnamed Parotes. Some time afterwards, during the
               ensuing reign, the wise Evagrius formed an intimacy with him. Evagrius was a wise
               man, powerful in thought and in word, and skillful in discerning the arguments which
               led to virtue and to vice, and capable in urging others to imitate the one, and to
               eschew the other. His eloquence is fully attested by the works he has left behind
               him. He was a citizen of Iberia, near the Euxine. He had philosophized and studied
               the Sacred Scriptures under Gregory, bishop of Nazianzen, and had filled the office
               of archdeacon when Gregory administered the church in Constantinople. He was handsome
               in person, and careful in his mode of attire; and hence an acquaintanceship he had
               formed with a certain lady excited the jealousy of her husband, who plotted his
               death. While the plot was about being carried forward into deed, God sent him while
               sleeping, a fearful and saving vision in a dream. It appeared to him that he had been
               arrested in the act of committing some crime, and that he was bound hand and foot
               in
               irons. As he was being led before the magistrates to receive the sentence of
               condemnation, a man who held in his hand the book of the Holy Gospels addressed him,
               and promised to deliver him from his bonds, and confirmed this 369 with an oath,
               provided he would quit the city. Evagrius touched the book, and made oath that he
               would do so. Immediately his chains appeared to fall off, and he awoke. He was
               convinced by this divine dream, and fled the danger. He resolved upon devoting
               himself to a life of asceticism, and proceeded from Constantinople to Jerusalem. Some
               time after he went to visit the philosophers of Scetis, and gladly determined to live
               there.

            <div>11. Evagrius the monk, the intimate disciple of the above mentioned Macarius,
               educated in sacred and profane literature and distinguished, whom the book which is
               called the <em>Lives of the fathers</em> mentions as a most continent and erudite
               man, wrote many things of use to monks among which are these: <em>Suggestions against
                  the eight principal sins</em> [= CPG 2434, <em>Antirrhetikos</em>]. He was first
               to mention or among the first at least to teach these setting against them eight
               books taken from the testimony of the Holy Scriptures only, after the example of our
               Lord, who always met his tempter with quotations from Scripture, so that every
               suggestion, whether of the devil or of depraved nature had a testimony against it.
               This work I have, under instructions, translated into Latin translating with the same
               simplicity which I found in the Greek. He composed also a book of <em>One hundred
                  sentiments</em> [= CPG 2430, <em>Praktikos</em>] for those living simply as
               anchorites, arranged by chapters, and one of <em>Fifty sentiments</em> [= CPG 2431,
               <em>Gnostikos</em>] for the erudite and studious, which I first translated into
               Latin. The former one, translated before, I restored, partly by retranslating and
               partly by emendation, so as to represent the true meaning of the author, because I
               saw that the translation was vitiated and confused by time. He composed also a
               doctrine of the common-life suited to Cenobites and Synodites [= CPG 2435, <em>Ad
                  monachos</em>], and to the virgin consecrated to God, a little book suitable to
               her religion and sex [= CPG 2436, <em>Sentences to a Virgin</em>]. He published also
               a few collections of opinions very obscure and, as he himself says of them, only to
               be understood by the hearts of monks, and these likewise I published in Latin [= CPG
               2477?, <em>Proverbs and Their Interpretation</em>]. He lived to old age, mighty in
               signs and miracles.

               doctors of the church and had a fine talent for elegant translation from Greek into
               Latin. In this way he opened to the Latin speaking church the greater part of the
               Greek literature; translating the works of Basil of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, Gregory
               Nazianzan, that most eloquent man, the Recognitions of Clement of Rome, the
                  <em>Church history</em> of Eusebius of Cæsarea in Palestine, the Sentences of
               Xystus, the <em>Sentences</em> of Evagrius and the work of Pamphilus Martyr

         <div class="text">
            
            <div>1. Abba Evagrius said, 'Sit in your cell, collecting your thoughts. Remember the
               day of your death. See then what the death of your body will be; let your spirit be
               heavy, take pains, condemn the vanity of the world, so as to be able to live always
               in the peace you have in view without weakening. Remember also what happens in hell
               and think about the state of the souls down there, their painful silence, their most
               bitter groanings, their fear, their strife, their waiting. Think of their grief
               without end and the tears their souls shed eternally. But keep the day of
               resurrection and of presentation to God in remembrance also. Imagine the fearful and
               terrible judgement. Consider the fate kept for sinners, their shame before the face
               of God and the angels and archangels and all men, that is to say, the punishments,
               the eternal fire, worms that rest not, the darkness, gnashing of teeth, fear and
               supplications. Consider also the good things in store for the righteous: confidence
               in the face of God the Father and His Son, the angels and archangels and all the
               people of the saints, the kingdom of heaven, and the gifts of that realm, joy and
               beatitude.
            </div>
            
            <div>'Keep in mind the remembrance of these two realities. Weep for the judgement of
               sinners, afflict yourself for fear lest you too feel those pains. But rejoice and
               be
               glad at the lot of the righteous. Strive to obtain those joys but be a stranger to
               those pains. Whether you be inside or outside your cell, be careful that the
               remembrance of these things never leaves you, so that, thanks to their remembrance
               you may at least flee wrong and harmful thoughts.'
            </div>
            
            <div>2. He also said, 'Restrain yourself from affection towards many people, for fear
               lest your spirit be distracted, so that your interior peace may not be
               disturbed.'
            </div>
            
            <div>3. He also said, 'It is a great thing to pray without distraction but to chant
               psalms without distraction is even greater.'
            </div>
            
            <div>4. He also said, 'Always keep your death in mind and do not forget the eternal
               judgement, then there will be no fault in your soul.'
            </div>
            
            <div>5. He also said, 'Take away temptations and no-one will be saved.'</div>
            
            <div>6. He also said that one of the Fathers used to say, 'Eat a little without
               irregularity; if charity is joined to this, it leads the monk rapidly to the
               threshhold of <em>apatheia</em>.'
            </div>
            
            <div>7. One day at the Cells, there was an assembly about some matter or other and Abba
               Evagrius held forth. Then the priest said to him, 'Abba, we know that if you were
               living in your own country you would probably be a bishop and a great leader; but
               at
               present you sit here as a stranger.' He was filled with compunction, but was not at
               all upset and bending his head he replied, 'I have spoken once and will not answer,
               twice but I will proceed no further.' (Job 40.5)

      <h3>Condemnation </h3>
      
      <div> The condemnation of Evagrius was intertwined with that of Origen (ca. 185–ca.
         251) and Didymus the Blind (ca. 313–ca. 398). In the twentieth century the argument
         was advanced that the strain of Origenism the Church condemned in the sixth was that
         of
         Evagrius, not Origen. In modern ecclesiastical circles this has moved some shadows
         of
         suspicion from the latter to the former. Not all scholars accept that Evagrius's role
         in
         the sixth-century controversies can be categorized so easily. First, it is unclear
         what
         role if any he played in the Origenistic controversy of his own day, the late 390s.
         Second,
         Evagrius's use of Origen is no more remarkable than the use made by less controversial
         figures such as Gregory Nazianzus and Basil of Caesarea.
      </div>
      
      <div>The Fifteen Anathemas of the 530s or 540s (when the third Origenist controversy reached
         its apex)—a formulation accepted as part of the Fifth Ecumenical Council by the
         Sixth and Seventh—show that one of Evagrius's major works, the <em>Kephalaia
            Gnostica</em>, or an adaptation of it, was the target of Orthodox polemic against
         Origenism. Below are early sources attesting to the condemnation or disapproval of
         Evagrius
         or certain works of his, whether directly or indirectly stated.

         <div class="text">
            
            <div>I. If anyone asserts the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert the
               monstrous restoration which follows from it: let him be anathema.
            </div>
            
            <div> II. If anyone shall say that the creation (τὴν παραγωγὴν) of all reasonable things
               includes only intelligences (νόες) without bodies and altogether immaterial, having
               neither number nor name, so that there is unity between them all by identity of
               substance, force and energy, and by their union with and knowledge of God the Word;
               but that no longer desiring the sight of God, they gave themselves over to worse
               things, each one following his own inclinations, and that they have taken bodies more
               or less subtile, and have received names, for among the heavenly Powers there is a
               difference of names as there is also a difference of bodies; and thence some became
               and are called Cherubims, others Seraphims, and Principalities, and Powers, and
               Dominations, and Thrones, and Angels, and as many other heavenly orders as there may
               be: let him be anathema. </div>
            
            <div> III. If anyone shall say that the sun, the moon and the stars are also reasonable
               beings, and that they have only become what they are because they turned towards
               evil: let him be anathema. 
            </div>
            
            <div> IV. If anyone shall say that the reasonable creatures in whom the divine love had
               grown cold have been hidden in gross bodies such as ours, and have been called men,
               while those who have attained the lowest degree of wickedness have shared cold and
               obscure bodies and are become and called demons and evil spirits: let him be
               anathema. 
            </div>
            
            <div> V. If anyone shall say that a psychic (ψυχικὴν) condition has come from an angelic
               or archangelic state, and moreover that a demoniac and a human condition has come
               from a psychic condition, and that from a human state they may become again angels
               and demons, and that each order of heavenly virtues is either all from those below or
               from those above, or from those above and below: let him be anathema. </div>
            
            <div> VI. If anyone shall say that there is a twofold race of demons, of which the one
               includes the souls of men and the other the superior spirits who fell to this, and
               that of all the number of reasonable beings there is but one which has remained
               unshaken in the love and contemplation of God, and that that spirit is become Christ
               and the king of all reasonable beings, and that he has created all the bodies which
               exist in heaven, on earth, and between heaven and earth; and that the world which has
               in itself elements more ancient than itself, and which exists by themselves, viz.:
               dryness, damp, heat and cold, and the image (ἰδέαν) to which it was formed, was so
               formed, and that the most holy and consubstantial Trinity did not create the world,
               but that it was created by the working intelligence (Νοῦς δημιουργός) which is more
               ancient than the world, and which communicates to it its being: let him be anathema. </div>
            
            <div> VII. If anyone shall say that Christ, of whom it is said that he appeared in the
               form of God, and that he was united before all time with God the Word, and humbled
               himself in these last days even to humanity, had (according to their expression) pity
               upon the divers falls which had appeared in the spirits united in the same unity (of
               which he himself is part), and that to restore them he passed through divers classes,
               had different bodies and different names, became all to all, an Angel among Angels,
               a
               Power among Powers, has clothed himself in the different classes of reasonable beings
               with a form corresponding to that class, and finally has taken flesh and blood like
               ours and is become man for men; [if anyone says all this] and does not profess that
               God the Word humbled himself and became man: let him be anathema. 
            </div>
            
            <div> VIII. If anyone shall not acknowledge that God the Word, of the same substance
               with the Father and the Holy Ghost, and who was made flesh and became man, one of the
               Trinity, is Christ in every sense of the word, but [shall affirm] that he is so only
               in an inaccurate manner, and because of the abasement (κενώσαντα), as they call it,
               of the intelligence (νοῦς); if anyone shall affirm that this intelligence united
               (συνημμένον) to God the Word, is the Christ in the true sense of the word, while the
               Logos is only called Christ because of this union with the intelligence, and <em>e
                  converso</em> that the intelligence is only called God because of the Logos: let
               him be anathema. 
            </div>
            
            <div> IX. If anyone shall say that it was not the Divine Logos made man by taking an
               animated body with a ψυχὴ λογικὴ and νοερὰ, that he descended into hell and ascended
               into heaven, but shall pretend that it is the Νοῦς which has done this, that Νοῦς of
               which they say (in an impious fashion) he is Christ properly so called, and that he
               is become so by the knowledge of the Monad: let him be anathema. </div>
            
            <div> X. If anyone shall say that after the resurrection the body of the Lord was
               ethereal, having the form of a sphere, and that such shall be the bodies of all after
               the resurrection; and that after the Lord himself shall have rejected his true body
               and after the others who rise shall have rejected theirs, the nature of their bodies
               shall be annihilated: let him be anathema. 
            </div>
            
            <div> XI. If anyone shall say that the future judgment signifies the destruction of the
               body and that the end of the story will be an immaterial φύσις, and that thereafter
               there will no longer be any matter, but only spirit (νοῦς): let him be anathema. </div>
            
            <div> XII. If anyone shall say that the heavenly Powers and all men and the Devil and
               evil spirits are united with the Word of God in all respects, as the Νοῦς which is by
               them called Christ and which is in the form of God, and which humbled itself as they
               say; and [if anyone shall say] that the Kingdom of Christ shall have an end: let him
               be anathema. </div>
            
            <div> XIII. If anyone shall say that Christ [i.e., the Νοῦς] is in no wise different
               from other reasonable beings, neither substantially nor by wisdom nor by his power
               and might over all things but that all will be placed at the right hand of God, as
               well as he that is called by them Christ [the Νοῦς], as also they were in the feigned
               pre-existence of all things: let him be anathema. </div>
            
            <div> XIV. If anyone shall say that all reasonable beings will one day be united in one,
               when the hypostases as well as the numbers and the bodies shall have disappeared, and
               that the knowledge of the world to come will carry with it the ruin of the worlds,
               and the rejection of bodies as also the abolition of [all] names, and that there
               shall be finally an identity of the γνῶσις and of the hypostasis; moreover, that in
               this pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the
               feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema. </div>
            
            <div> XV. If anyone shall say that the life of the spirits (νοῶν) shall be like to the
               life which was in the beginning while as yet the spirits had not come down or fallen,
               so that the end and the beginning shall be alike, and that the end shall be the true
               measure of the beginning: let him be anathema.</div>

         <div class="text">
            
            <div>600. A brother asked the holy Old Man, Abba Barsanuphius, saying: "Father, I do not
               know how I came upon the books of Origen and Didymus, as well as the <em>Gnostic
                  Chapters</em> of Evagrius and the writing of his disciples. These books say that
               human souls were not created with the bodies but pre-existed them, being naked
               intellects or bodiless. Similarly, they say that both angels and demons were naked
               intellects. Human beings were condemned to the body because of their transgression,
               while angels became what they are by preserving their original condition. Demons,
               however, became what they are as a result of great evil. In fact, they say many other
               things of this nature, such as that the future hell must have an end and that human
               beings, angels, and demons can return to the state they first enjoyed as naked
               intellects, something they call <em>apokatastasis</em>.
            </div>
            
            <div>"Therefore, my soul is afflicted, falling into doubt as to whether these things are
               true or not. Master, I entreat you to show me the truth so that I may hold to this
               and not perish. For nothing is said about these things in sacred Scripture. As Origen
               himself affirms in his <em>Commentary on the Letter to Titus</em>, this is the
               tradition neither of the apostles nor of the church, namely, that the soul is an
               older creation than the body, as if he was characterizing any person saying this as
               being a heretic.
            </div>
            
            <div>"Nevertheless, Evagrius, too, bears witness to this in his <em>Gnostic
                  Chapters</em>, that no one has spoken of these things, nor has the Spirit itself
               explained them. For in his sixty-fourth chapter of the second century of his
               <em>Gnostic Chapters</em>, he writes: 'On the former, no one has spoken to us; on
               the latter, only the one on Mt. Horeb has explained to us.' and again, in the
               sixty-ninth chapter of the same century, he likewise says: 'The Holy Spirit has not
               explained to us the first distinction between rational beings, nor the first essence
               of bodies.' That there is no <em>apokatastasis</em> or end to hell, the Lord himself
               revealed to us in the Gospel, saying: 'These will go away into eternal punishment';
               and again 'Where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched.'
            </div>
            
            <div>"Therefore, master, how could these people expound such teachings, when the
               apostles have not passed them down to us and the Holy Spirit has not explained them
               to us, as they themselves bear witness and as the Gospels contradict? Be merciful,
               then, with my weakness, since you are a father of compassion, and show me clearly
               what these doctrines are about." Response by Barsanuphius[:]
            </div>
            
            <div>Brother, woe upon and alas for our race...! Truly, brother, I have left behind my
               own mourning, and I mourn over your fall; I have stopped weeping over my own sins,
               and I weep for you as if for my own child. The heavens tremble over the
               preoccupations of human beings. The earth shakes over how people want to scrutinize
               the incomprehensible. These are the doctrines of the Greeks; they are the vain talk
               of people who claim to be something. Such words belong to idle people and are created
               through deceit....
            </div>
            
            <div>For I bear witness before God that you have fallen into a pit of the devil and into
               ultimate death. Therefore, avoid these things and follow in the footsteps of the
               fathers. Acquire humility and obedience for yourself, as well as mourning, ascetic
               discipline, poverty, not reckoning yourself as anything, and other such virtues,
               which you will find in their <em>Sayings</em> and in the <em>Lives</em>....
            </div>
            
            <div>601. The same brother asked the same question to the Other Old Man, Abba John.
               Response by John[:]
            </div>
            
            <div>"Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is unspiritual and demonic." [James
               3:15] This teaching is from the devil, leading to eternal hell those who pay
               attention to it. Anyone who is preoccupied with this teaching becomes a heretic;
               anyone who believes in it has deviated from truth; anyone who adheres to it is
               alienated from God's way. The workers of Christ, however, are not like this; the
               disciples of Christ have not taught this. Those who accept the word of truth do not
               accept such teachings. Brother, quickly detach yourself from these. Do not burn your
               heart with the fire of the devil. Do not sow thorns on your soil instead of grain;
               do
               not receive death instead of life. In short, do not receive the devil instead of
               Christ. Do not delay in these, and you will be saved like Lot from Sodom, through
               the
               prayers of the saints. Amen.
            </div>
            
            <div>602. The same brother asked the same Old Man: "Should we not, then, read even the
               works of Evagrius?" Response by John[:]
            </div>
            
            <div>Do not accept such doctrines from his works; but go ahead and read, if you like,
               those works that are beneficial for the soul, according to the parable about the net
               in the Gospel. For it has been written: "They placed the good into baskets, but threw
               out the bad." [Matt. 13:48] You, too, should do the same.
            </div>
            
            <div>603. The same brother, who asked these questions, had doubts within himself,
               thinking and saying: "So how is it that some of the fathers in our time accept these
               teachings, and yet we regard them as being good monks and pay attention to their
               advice?" And some days later, it happened that this brother also asked the Great Old
               Man to pray for him. Then the Old Man revealed to him, of his own accord, what the
               brother was actually thinking in his heart, so that the latter was surprised and
               astounded[:]
            </div>
            
            <div>Since you said and thought: "Why is it that some of the fathers accept the
               <em>Gnostic Chapters</em> of Evagrius?" it is true that certain brothers, who
               regard themselves as knowledgeable, accept these writings; but they have not asked
               God whether they are true. And God has left them to their own knowledge on this
               matter. Nevertheless, it is neither my role nor yours to pursue these matters; for
               our time is given us to examine our passions, as well as to weep and mourn for
               them.

            <div>36. Agapetus on becoming superior of the New Laura found four monks in the
               community, admitted there by the simple-minded Paul out of ignorance about them, who
               whispered in secret the doctrines of Origen; their leader was a Palestinian called
               Nonnus, who, pretending to be a Christian and simulating piety, held the doctrines
               of
               the godless Greeks, Jews, and Manichees, that is, the myths concerning preexistence
               related by Origen, Evagrius, and Didymus. Fearing lest the corruption of heresy
               should spread to others, the blessed Agapetus, with the agreement of the sainted
               Archbishop Elias and at his bidding, expelled them from the New Laura; on being
               expelled they went off to the plain, to sow their pernicious weeds there.

               common and universal anathema was directed against Origen and Theodore of Mopsuestia
               and against the teaching of Evagrius and Didymus on preexistence and a universal
               restoration, in the presence and with the approval of the four patriarchs.

               Pythagoras and Plato, from Origen, Evagrius, and Didymus. I am amazed what vain and
               futile labors they have expended on such harmful and laborious vanities, and how in
               this way they have armed their tongues against piety.

            <div>4.38 After some other matter, [those at the holy synod] proceed to set forth
               fourteen chapters concerning the right and unimpeachable faith. In this manner had
               the transactions proceeded: but on the presentation of libels against the doctrine
               of
               Origen, named also Adamantius, and the followers of his impious error, by the monks
               Eulogius, Conon, Cyriacus, and Pancratius, Justinian addresses a question to the
               synod concerning these points, appending to it a copy of the libel, as well as the
               epistle of Vigilius upon the subject: from the whole of which may be gathered the
               attempts of Origen to fill the simplicity of the apostolic doctrine with philosophic
               and Manichaean tares. Accordingly, a relation was addressed to Justinian by the
               synod, after they had uttered exclamations against Origen and the maintainers of
               similar errors. A portion of it is expressed in the following terms: "O most
               Christian emperor, gifted with heavenly generosity of soul," and so forth. "We have
               shunned, accordingly, we have shunned this error; for we knew not the voice of the
               alien; and having bound such a one, as a thief and a robber, in the cords of our
               anathema, we have ejected him from the sacred precincts." And presently they proceed:
               "By perusal you will learn the vigour of our acts." To this they appended a statement
               of the heads of the matters which the followers of Origen were taught to maintain,
               shewing their agreements, as well as their disagreements, and their manifold errors.
               The fifth head contains the blasphemous expressions uttered by private individuals
               belonging to what is called the New Laura, as follows. Theodore, surnamed Ascidas,
               the Cappadocian, said "If the Apostles and Martyrs at the present time work miracles,
               and are already so highly honoured, unless they shall be equal with Christ in the
               restitution of things, in what respect is there a restitution for them?" They also
               reported many other blasphemies of Didymus, Evagrius, and Theodore; having with great
               diligence extracted whatever bore upon these points.

               all men he was the most sensible in all he thought and said. The poor man was quite
               mistaken, of course, and in this matter as in many others he proved himself
               outstandingly foolish. He says: "When our soul wants different foods, keep it on
               bread and water," (<em>Praktikos</em> 16) a statement that is like telling a child to
               climb the entire ladder in a single stride. So let us reject him and say: When our
               soul wants different foods, it is looking for what is proper to its nature.

            <div>In this year 25 of the reign of Justinian, the 11th after the sole consulship of
               Flavius Basilius, there took place in Constantinople the 5th Synod against the
               impious and abominable and unclean and pagan doctrines alien from Christianity of
               Origen and Didymus and Evagrius, the opponents of God, and of Theodore the impious
               and his Jewish writings, and against the unclean letter to Maris the Persian called
               that of Ibas, and the foolish writings of Theodoret against the 12 Chapters of Cyril,
               our most holy father and teacher.

            following closely the straight path of the holy and approved Fathers, has piously
            given
            its full assent to the five holy and Ecumenical Synods (that is to say, to that of
            the

            Constantinople of the 150 God-inspired men against Macedonius the adversary of the
            Spirit, and the impious Apollinaris; and also the first in Ephesus of 200 venerable
            men
            convened against Nestorius the Judaizer; and that in Chalcedon of 630 God-inspired
            Fathers against Eutyches and Dioscorus hated of God; and in addition to these, to
            the
            last, that is the Fifth holy Synod assembled in this place, against Theodore of
            Mopsuestia, Origen, Didymus, and Evagrius, and the writings of Theodoret against the
            Twelve Chapters of the celebrated Cyril, and the Epistle which was said to be written
