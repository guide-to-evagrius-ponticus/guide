                  <div class="who">kalvesmaki</div>From the source: Translation by Luke Dysinger,
      O.S.B. (translation in public domain) Note that the the majority of the Greek text below is
      Frankenberg’s retroversion from the [UNRELIABLE!] Syriac S1 MS. This text, should be used with
      extreme caution: it is NOT the basis for this English translation, which relies principally
      on: [1] Guillaumont’s Syriac S2 version, [2] his French translation of S2, and [3] assorted
      Greek fragments.[1] [1] The complete text of Evagrius’ Kephalaia Gnostica survives only in
      Syriac and Armenian translations with extant Greek fragments and parallels available for only
      about one-sixth of the complete text. The majority of these fragments are reproduced in the
      Greek text above, BUT the Greek text above largely consists of a retroversion into Greek of
      Frankenberg’s 1912 edition of the UNRELIABLE Syriac text (which includes a commentary by the
      seventh-century anti-Origenist abbot, Babai the Great). Guillaumont designated this the S1
      version of the Kephalaia Gnostica: it contains no evidence of the controversial Origenist
      doctrine condemned by councils from the sixth century onwards. The problematic nature of this
      S1 version was clarified in 1958, when Antoine Guillaumont published the critical edition of a
      new Syriac version based on a manuscript tradition he designated S2. This version exists in
      only a single manuscript. Although known in antiquity, it had been denounced by ancient Syriac
      authors as the work of heretical forgers who were alleged to have intentionally altered texts
      by ‘the blessed abbot Evagrius’ in order to justify their own teachings. The surviving Greek
      fragments of the Kephalaia Gnostica uniformly attest to the priority of the S2 version,
      revealing the more widespread S1 tradition to be a drastic re-editing of Evagrius’ text ,in
      which all passages suggestive of controversial Origenist doctrine had either been eliminated
      or modified. This (expurgated) S1 version appeared very quickly, possibly anticipating by
      several decades the anathemas of 543 and 553. The Syriac manuscript evidence places it no
      later than the first third of the sixth century; and an Armenian translation of S1 may have
      been made sometime in the fifth century, that is within a century of Evagrius’ death in 399.
      The existence of both expurgated and unexpurgated versions of Evagrius’ works during the sixth
      century reflects an uneasy attitude of reverence for his writings combined with anxiety
      concerning their orthodoxy which is well-attested elsewhere in the monastic literature of the
      period. The Syriac and Greek Versions used here include the following: the critical edition of
      Syriac S1 and S2 texts ed. and trans. by A. Guillaumont, Les six Centuries des ‘Kephalaia
      Gnostica’ d’Évagre le Pontique, Patrologia Orientalis 28.1, Nº 134 (Paris, 1958). Syriac S1
