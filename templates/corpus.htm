        <h2> Writings of Evagrius Ponticus </h2>
        <div class="c-preface dcap">The works of Evagrius, few of which are preserved entire in Greek,
            survive haphazardly: in anthologies; in quotations; in ancient Syriac, Armenian, or
            Latin translations; or in pseudonymous collections ascribed to more acceptable authors,
            such as St. Basil or St. Nilus. Because of the complexity of the manuscript tradition,
            editing Evagrius's writings is an ongoing, painstaking process. Below is the list of all
            known works, along with editions and translations in the bibliography. The <em>Clavis
                patrum graecorum</em> (CPG), supplemented by recent scholarship, has been followed
            for assigning certainty of authorship.</div>
        <div class="c-preface collapse">
            <div class="label">About the data</div>
            <div>This table is based primarily upon the suite of <a
                    href="https://github.com/Arithmeticus/TAN-Evagrius">master TAN XML files</a>,
                coupled with the <a href="http://www.zotero.org/groups/evagrius_ponticus">Zotero
                    database</a>. Up to 2019, the Zotero database was the primary location for
                maintaining lists of editions and translations, which was adequate for general
                needs. In time, I wanted to make more precise assertions, and to include manuscript
                evidence. Such complex relationships could not be made in the bibliographic
                database, so during 2019, a period that saw only one new edition of the
                    <em>Guide</em>, I shifted the checklist from the Zotero databse to the master <a
                    href="tan/TAN-A/evagrius.TAN-A.xml">TAN-A file</a>, opening up new
                opportunities, and a much larger list of things yet to do.</div>
            <div>Because so much remains to be done, the data in the table below should be treated
                as correct but not exhaustive. The lists of ancient versions, editions,
                translations, and transcriptions are incomplete, and imprecise. At this time, only
                CPG 2430 and 2431 have been curated. All other entries take up from the rather rough
                assertions made in previous versions, dependent upon the Zotero database. For
                example, Dysinger is credited with editions of many works, when in actuality, he is
                simply transcribing the text of a previous edition. </div>
            <div>In future editions of the <em>Guide</em> the lists will become increasingly
                complete and accurate. The goal is to develop this table into a master checklist of
                all editions, translations, and manuscripts, and to provide access to transcriptions
                of every version of Evagrius's works that may be permissibly published. At present, the
                only manuscripts catalogued are those whose transcriptions are incorporated into the
                    <em>Guide</em>. </div>
            <div>Unless otherwise specified, all factual assertions are my responsibility.</div>
