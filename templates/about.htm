        <div>The <em>Guide to Evagrius Ponticus</em> includes, under <a href="corpus.htm"
            >Writings</a>, many versions of Evagrius's writings, and only those versions without
            license restrictions. This includes a number of texts in Greek, Syriac, and other
            ancient languages, drawn from the main text of modern critical editions. In United
            States, as elsewhere, courts have followed the general principle that any faithful
            reproduction of a public domain work is itself in the public domain (United States: <a

                v. Corel</a>; France: <a

                    v. Garnier</a> [commentary: <a href="https://apocryphes.hypotheses.org/389"
                        >Rouquette</a>, <a
                            href="https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2014/04/14/copyright-and-critical-editions-a-french-court-says-the-text-is-not-copyright/"
                            >Pearse</a>]). The main text of a critical edition is not "recast, transformed, or
            or adapted" (U.S.C. <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title17/chapter1"
                >17.101</a>) and so is not a derivative or creative work; it remains the
            intellectual property of the original creator (in this case, Evagrius or an ancient
            translator). </div>
        <div>Nevertheless, those critical editions are challenging and expensive to produce and
            publish, and they are they the only proper way to fully appreciate how the main text
            should be understood. Readers are advised to support scholars and publishers by
            purchasing copies of the underlying critical editions.</div>
