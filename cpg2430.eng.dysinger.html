      O.S.B. (translation in public domain) Greek text based on: Sources Chrétiennes N° 171;&amp; PG
      40.[1] [1] ENGLISH TEXT: This translation owes much to the literal and melifluous version by
      Simon Tugwell, O.P., Evagrius Ponticus, Praktikos &amp; On Prayer (Oxford:Faculty of Theology,
      1987). Serious students of Evagrius are urged to obtain the excellent translation of Robert E.
      Sinkewicz, Evagrius Ponticus, The Greek Ascetic Corpus (Oxford U.P., 2003). Less literal
      English translations of Evagrius’ Praktikos may be found in: Early Fathers from the Philokalia
      (Faber) The Philocalia, vol. 1 (Faber); and J. E. Bamberger's Evagrius Ponticus, Praktikos and
      Chapters on Prayer (Cistercian). GREEK TEXT: The Greek version given above is based on both
      Migne (PG 40, 1220-1236, 1244-1252, 1272-1276.) and the critical edition of A &amp; C.

                  the face of those who are always attempting to beat and wound it. Anyone who bears
                  this hood on his head is truly chanting [the inner meaning of the psalm], Unless the
                  Lord builds the house and guards the city, in vain do the builder and watchman labor.
                  Words like these produce humility and uproot the primordial vice of pride that cast
                  Lucifer the Day-Star down to the earth.

               every [tempting-]thought: first is that of gluttony; and with it, sexual immorality;
               third, love of money; fourth, sadness; fifth, anger; sixth acedia; seventh, vainglory;
               eighth, pride. Whether these thoughts are able to disturb the soul or not is not up
               to us; but whether they linger or not, and whether they arouse passions or not; that
               is up to us.

               <div class="type">chapter</div>The [tempting]-thought of gluttony suggests to the monk the quick abandonment of his
               asceticism. The stomach, liver, spleen, and [resultant] congestive heart failure are
               depicted, along with long sickness, lack of necessities, and unavailability of physicians.
               It often leads him to recall those of the brethren who have suffered these things.
               Sometimes it even deceives those who have suffered from this kind of thing to go and
               visit [others] who are practicing self-control, to tell them all about their misfortunes
               and how this resulted from their asceticism.

               <div class="type">chapter</div>The demon of sexual immorality compels desiring for different bodies. Especially violently
               does it attack those who practice self-control, so that they will cease, as if achieving
               nothing. Contaminating the soul, it bends it down towards these sorts of deeds: it
               makes it speak certain words and then hear them, as if the thing were actually there
               to be seen.

               <div class="type">chapter</div>Sadness sometimes arises from frustrated desires; but sometimes it is the result of
               anger. When desires are frustrated it arises thus: certain [tempting-]thoughts first
               sieze the soul and remind it of home and parents and its former course of life. When
               they see the soul following them without resistance, and dissipating itself in mental
               pleasures, they take and dunk [lit baptize] it in sadness, since it is the case that
               these earlier things are gone and cannot be recovered due to the [monk's] present
               way of life Then the miserable soul, having been dissipated by the first [tempting-]thought,
               is humiliated all the more by the second.

               <div class="type">chapter</div>Anger is the sharpest passion. It is said to be a boiling up and movement of indignation
               (thumos) against a wrongdoer or a presumed wrongdoer: it causes the soul to be savage
               all day long, but especially in prayers it siezes the nous, reflecting back the face
               of the distressing person. Then sometimes it is lingering and is changed into rancor:
               [thus] it causes disturbances at night; bodily weakness and pallor; and attacks from
               poisonous beasts. These four things associated with rancor may be found to have been
               summoned up by many other tempting- thoughts.

               <div class="type">chapter</div>The demon of acedia, which is also called the noonday demon, is the most burdensome
               of all the demons. It besets the monk at about the fourth hour (10 am) of the morning,
               encircling his soul until about the eighth hour (2 pm). [1] First it makes the sun
               seem to slow down or stop moving, so that the day appears to be fifty hours long.
               [2] Then it makes the monk keep looking out of his window and forces him to go bounding
               out of his cell to examine the sun to see how much longer it is to 3 o’clock, and
               to look round in all directions in case any of the brethren is there. [3] Then it
               makes him hate the place and his way of life and his manual work It makes him think
               that there is no charity left among the brethren; no one is going to come and visit
               him. [4] If anyone has upset the monk recently, the demon throws this in too to increase
               his hatred [5] It makes him desire other places where he can easily find all that
               he needs and practice an easier, more convenient craft After all, pleasing the Lord
               is not dependent on geography, the demon adds; God is to be worshipped everywhere.
               [6] It joins to this the remembrance of the monk’s family and his previous way of
               life, and suggests to him that he still has a long time to live, raising up before
               his eyes a vision of how burdensome the ascetic life is. So, it employs, as they say,
               every [possible] means to move the monk to abandon his cell and give up the race.
               No other demon follows on immediately after this one but after its struggle the soul
               bs taken over by a peaceful condition and by unspeakable joy

               lives are going well, [A] wanting to publish their efforts [B] and go hunting for
               glory among men; [1] it raises up a fantasy of demons shouting, [2] and women being
               healed, [3] and a crowd of people wanting to touch the monk’s clothes. [4] It prophesies
               priesthood for him, and sets the stage with people thronging at his door, calling
               for him, and even though he resists he will be carried off under constraint. Then,
               having raised him up with empty hopes like this, it suddenly leaps away and leaves
               him, abandoning him to be tempted either by the demon of pride or by the demon of
               gloominess, which brings on thoughts contrary to the previous hopes Sometimes it also
               hands over to the demon of sexual immorality the man who, a moment before, was being
               carried off forcibly to be made a holy priest.

               and[2b] charity and[2c] self-control; [3] in the Irascible part,[3a] courage and [3b]
               patience. [4] But in the Whole of the Soul [it] is justice. [1A] Now the task of Prudence
               is [1A.1] to plan the attack against the opposing powers and [1A.2] to defend the
               virtues, [1A.3] to stand prepared against the vices, [1A.4] and to administer neutral
               matters according to the [requirements of the] times. [1B] [The task] of Understanding:
               to direct harmoniously all things which help us toward our goal. [1C] [The task] of
               Wisdom: contemplation of the logoi of corporeal and incorporeal beings. [2A] The work
               of Temperance: to look serenely upon those affairs which provoke within us irrational
               phantasies. [2B] of Charity: all the images of God, showing one another to be as nearly
               like the prototype as possible no matter how the demons ply their arts to defile them.
               [2c] Of Continence: every pleasure of the palate with joy to decline. [3A] Not to
               fear the enemies and [3B] eagerly to endure afflictions belongs to Courage and Patience.
               [4] Justice effects a certain symphony and harmony among the [different] parts of
               the soul.

               joined to love. The same man freed one of the brethren who was being troubled by fantasies
