        <h2> Writings of Evagrius Ponticus </h2>
        <div class="c-preface"> The works of Evagrius, few of which are preserved entire in Greek,
            survive haphazardly: in anthologies; in quotations; in ancient Syriac, Armenian, or
            Latin translations; or in pseudonymous collections ascribed to more acceptable authors,
            such as St. Basil or St. Nilus. Because of the complexity of the manuscript tradition,
            editing Evagrius's writings is an ongoing, painstaking process. Below is the list of all
            known works, along with editions and translations in the bibliography. The <em>Clavis
                patrum graecorum</em> (CPG) has been followed for assigning certainty of
            authorship.</div>
