               That is why, to those who are still besieged by passions it is necessary to speak
               not words of peace, but how they will triumph over their adversaries: indeed, as Ecclesiastes
               says, "there is no discharge [from service] on the day of battle."Those, therefore,
               who are still afflicted with the passions and who peer into the logoi of bodies and

               logoi; for this latter belongs to wisdom alone, according to the tradition we have
               received. (2) Courage is steadfast perseverance in the truth, even to the point of
               combat, as well as refraining from entry into that which has no existence. (3) The
               reception of the first sower’s seed and the rejection of what is sown secondarily
               - this is the proper work of continence, according to [Gregory’s] explanation. (4)
               Justice’s task is to give to each, according to his worth, a word: that is, proclaiming
               some things darkly; using parables to make other things known; and clearly explaining
               still others for the benefit of the simple.
