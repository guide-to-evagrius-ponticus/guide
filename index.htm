			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Evagrius Ponticus (b. 345 in Ibora; d. 399 in Egypt), a monastic theologian, was one
				of the most talented intellects of the fourth century. Circulating in elite
				ecclesiastical circles of Cappadocia and Asia Minor, he began his career under Basil
				of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus, serving with the latter in Constantinople
				through a stormy tenure that culminated in the Second Ecumenical Council (381).
				Known then as a brilliant heresiologist, Evagrius seemed destined for a successful
				ecclesiastical career. He chose a different course, and fled to Jerusalem, where he
				took vows in the monastic communities of Rufinus and Melania. From there he
				traveled to Egypt and lived in monasteries in Nitria and Kellia. In Egypt he wrote
				extensively in a variety of genres&#x2014;letters, proverbs, brief sayings
				(chapters), and treatises&#x2014;nearly all geared toward explaining and analyzing
				vice and virtue, demons and angels, psychological and psychosomatic
				phenomena&#x2014;in sum, the life of the ascetic. His accounts are set, sometimes
				explicitly, oftentimes pensively, within a well-developed metaphysical system that
				responded to both classical philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Stoicism) and the theology
				of some of the most accomplished Christian intellectuals (Clement of Alexandria,
				Origen, Gregory of Nazianzus).</p>
			<p>Although well connected in his own time, Evagrius fell into disrepute in the sixth
				century, when his writings, along with those of Origen and Didymus the Blind, were
				associated with a theological strain of Origenism condemned at the Fifth Ecumenical
				Council (553). The more speculative of Evagrius's writings fell out of circulation
				in the Byzantine Greek manuscript tradition. Those works survive in a number of
				other languages, principally Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, and
				Arabic&#x2014;linguistic traditions whose reception of Origen and Evagrius were not
				as controversial. His writings deeply influenced many theologians and monastic
				writers, including Sts. John Cassian, "Dionysius the Areopagite," Maximus Confessor,
				John Climacus, Isaac of Nineveh, and Simeon the New Theologian. The Armenian
				Orthodox Church commemorates him, as did some Syriac-speaking Orthodox churches, but
				his condemnation is maintained by the Eastern Orthodox Church and, with important
				caveats (e.g., his recent inclusion in <em>Butler's Lives of the Saints</em>), the
				Roman Catholic Church.</p>
			<p>This <em>Guide</em> provides definitive lists of Evagrius's works, of editions and
				translations of those works, and of studies related to his life and thought. It
				includes an inventory of key ancient sources that refer to Evagrius and a display of
				imagery from the ancient world. Updated quarterly, the <em>Guide</em> will gradually
				introduce a manuscript checklist, images of manuscripts, transcriptions of those
				manuscripts, and open source critical editions of Evagrius's writings. </p>
